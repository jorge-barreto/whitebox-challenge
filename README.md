the adjoining `results.xlsx` is generated by the script.

the script assumes the database is hosted on localhost:3306, and named "boingus". the password used to connect is "my-secret-pw". you can find these particulars in `index.js`.


In general, I'd say this was a quick attempt at hacking together a solution. The finished result is code which I am fairly unhappy to release: it is nearly impossible to work on without reading the entirety of it. There's plenty that could be done to fix this, but ultimately it comes down to how much time I had to move the solution from proof of concept to polished result. That is: there's very little polish here.

Enjoy!
